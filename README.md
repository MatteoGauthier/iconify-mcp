# Iconify MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides access to Iconify's extensive collection of icons through Claude and other MCP-compatible AI assistants.

## What is Iconify?

- üìö **Framework support** - React, Vue, Svelte, Lit, Ember, Web Components, and more
- üé® **Customization guidance** - Learn how to style and modify icons
- üìê **Layout shift prevention** - CSS snippets to avoid UI jumps

### Usage with Claude Desktop

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Configure Claude Desktop to use the server:
   
   Open your Claude Desktop configuration file:
   
   **macOS/Linux**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
   **Windows**: `%AppData%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

   Add this server to your configuration:

   ```json
   {
       "mcpServers": {
           "iconify": {
               "command": "npm",
               "args": [
                   "start",
                   "--prefix",
                   "/path/to/iconify-mcp"
               ]
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. Restart Claude Desktop
4. Ask Claude to find icons or generate implementation code

### Example queries

Here are some things you can ask Claude while connected to this server:

- "Find me icons related to home"
- "I need a shopping cart icon for my React app"
- "How do I prevent layout shifts with Iconify icons?"
- "Show me how to customize icon colors in Vue"
- "Generate unplugin-icons configuration for Vite with Vue 3"
- "How do I create custom icon collections with unplugin-icons?"

## Using unplugin-icons

[unplugin-icons](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-icons) is a powerful plugin that provides icon components for various build tools and frameworks. This MCP server offers enhanced support for unplugin-icons:

### Key features

- üîå **Universal support** - Works with Vite, Webpack, Rollup, and esbuild
- üß© **Auto-imports** - Use icons without manual imports
- üé® **Customization** - Modify icons via query parameters or global options
- üì¶ **Custom collections** - Create and use your own icon sets

### Getting unplugin-icons configuration

Ask Claude queries like:
- "Generate unplugin-icons config for Vite and React"
- "How do I set up unplugin-icons with custom collections?"
- "Show me how to customize icon sizes in unplugin-icons"
