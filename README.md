# Iconify MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides access to Iconify's extensive collection of icons through Claude and other MCP-compatible AI assistants.

## What is Iconify?

Iconify is a unified icon framework that provides access to over 200,000 icons from more than 150 open-source icon sets. With Iconify, you can:

- Use icons from multiple icon sets with a consistent API
- Load icons on demand - only fetch the icons you actually use
- Implement icons with your preferred framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- Avoid layout shifts with proper CSS configuration
